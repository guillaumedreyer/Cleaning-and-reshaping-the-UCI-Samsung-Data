The repo contains the three following files:

1. "run_analysis.R": An R file which performs an analysis on the 
"Samsung Galaxy S smartphone" datasets available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .  The code "run_analysis.R" downloads the data in the working directory. Then accesses and merges the different datasets contained the zip file, and performs various transformations to return a clean, organized and legible tidy dataset. The tidy dataset is returned as a txt file called "run_analysis.R_results.txt".


2. "CodeBook.md": A code book that describes the variables contained in the tidy dataset "run_analysis.R_results.txt" returned by the R code "run_analysis.R", as well as an explanation of the data analysis performed by this code.


3. "run_analysis.R_results.txt": The txt file created by the R code "run_analysis.R". It contains the tidy datasets produced by the R code "run_analysis.R".
