The repo contains the three following files:


1. "run_analysis.R": This is a R file which performs an analysis on the 
"Samsung Galaxy S smartphone" datasets available at 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .

The code "run_analysis.R" accesses and merges the datasets contained in the above zip file 
to return a clean, organized and legible tidy dataset showing the average of every
measurement corresponding to a mean or a standard deviation value, for each subject 
and activity. The tidy dataset is returned as the txt file "run_analysis.R_results.txt".  


2. "CodeBook.md": This file is a code book that describes the variables and
the data analysis performed by the script "run_analysis.R".


3. "run_analysis.R_results.txt": This is a txt file showing the tidy datasets produced by
the code "run_analysis.R".
